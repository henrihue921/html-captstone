<h2>My top three movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pink Panther</h3>
<p>This was the funniest movie I have ever seen. I've watched this movie more than 100 times.</p>
<h3>The Mask</h3>
<p>This to me was the most unique and refreshingly brilliant movies I had ever seen</p>
<h3>SAW</h3>
<p>This had the best plot twist I had ever experienced. I've watched many movies and I am pretty good at seeing where
    the possible directions. However, this movie blew my mind.</p>
